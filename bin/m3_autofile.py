"""Eidetic v6 M3 — auto-file recalled answers (claim-support gated, no laundering).

M3 closes Karpathy's loop — "good answers get filed back into the wiki as new
pages" — but ONLY through a claim-support gate WITH TEETH, at the agent cold-start
confidence (0.40, below the 0.55 injection gate), so filing can NEVER launder an
unverified claim into a trusted, injected card.

Turn-1 CORE (the laundering-critical pipeline):
  * FR-1 dedup — probe the vector index (M1/M2's v1.1 door, S2); a top neighbor
    ≥ M3_DEDUP_MIN is a near-duplicate → route the answer to M2 (update), file NO
    new page. On an FTS-only store the door returns [] → no semantic dedup.
  * FR-2 claim-support gate WITH TEETH — split the answer into material claim
    sentences; score each against ITS cited span(s) (LLM-free deterministic
    span-overlap by default; a cross-encoder may be registered). ANY material
    claim below M3_SUPPORT_MIN, or NO cited sources at all ⇒ the WHOLE answer is
    REJECTED (no page, no event). Fail toward REJECT.
  * FR-3 file — a supported, non-duplicate answer is written as a new typed page
    (source=agent-extracted, managed lifecycle) with confidence EXACTLY 0.40 and
    an EMPTY `## Evidence` log: fold(0.40, []) == 0.40 (NOT 0.45 — NO synthetic
    `observed` seed is written). The filing act mints NO promoting event; the page
    is recall-only until a LATER genuine tier-≥2 event (FR-4, deferred to turn 2).
  * FR-7 dark-safe — M3 files/gates/emits ONLY when EIDETIC_CONFIDENCE_EVENTS is
    on AND the M3 activation flag is set. With either off M3 is a COMPLETE no-op
    (no page, no event) so the confidence dark-run zero-diff holds. M3 is NOT
    wired into the ingest indexer: it is driven by the (turn-2) session-end /
    recall-path producer of the input contract below.

REUSE (no new door / no ENGINE_API delta, "1.1"): M1's v1.1 door via
`m1_contradiction.neighbors_via_door` (S2); the typed-page writer
(`remember.build_card` / `_atomic_write`, `compound.resolve_memory_dir`); the M2
hand-off (`m2_synthesis.process_trigger`); the op-log. NO LLM anywhere in the
scoring path. `embed.py`/`rerank.py` stay unforked.

--- Input contract (the turn-1 seam) ---------------------------------------
M3 consumes a TYPED PROVENANCE RECORD (a plain dict), NOT a transcript:

    {"answer_text": str,                       # the synthesized recalled answer
     "sources": [{"card_id": str,              # a cited source card
                  "span": str}, ...],          # the cited chunk text (ground truth)
     "recall_query": str,                      # what was asked
     "session_id": str}                        # the originating session

The CONSUMER (this module: gate + dedup + file) is LIVE. The PRODUCER (a
session-end hook mining the transcript, or the recall/answer path writing this
record) is a documented seam, DEFERRED to turn 2 — so `file_recalled_answer` is
driven directly (like M2's `process_trigger`). An answer with NO traceable
sources is rejected outright (FR-2): fail toward reject.
